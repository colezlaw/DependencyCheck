Usage
======================
Dependency-check-maven is very simple to utilize and can be used as a stand-alone
plugin or as part of the site plugin.

It is important to understand that the first time this task is executed it may
take 20 minutes or more as it downloads and processes the data from the National
Vulnerability Database (NVD) hosted by NIST: https://nvd.nist.gov

After the first batch download, as long as the plugin is executed at least once every
seven days the update will only take a few seconds.

### Create the DependencyCheck-report.html in the target directory

```xml
<project>
    <build>
        <plugins>
            ...
            <plugin>
              <groupId>org.owasp</groupId>
              <artifactId>dependency-check-maven</artifactId>
              <version>${project.version}</version>
              <configuration>
                  <failBuildOnCVSS>8</failBuildOnCVSS>
              </configuration>
              <executions>
                  <execution>
                      <goals>
                          <goal>check</goal>
                      </goals>
                  </execution>
              </executions>
            </plugin>
            ...
        </plugins>
        ...
    </build>
    ...
</project>
```

Note, the above configuration will fail the build if any dependencies are found
to have vulnerabilities with a CVSS score greater then 8. If you do not wish to
fail the build for CVSS scores do not specify the failBuildOnCVSS element.

### Create the dependency-check report within the site

```xml
<project>
    <build>
        <plugins>
            ...
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
                <configuration>
                    <reportPlugins>
                        <plugin>
                            <groupId>org.owasp</groupId>
                            <artifactId>dependency-check-maven</artifactId>
                            <version>${project.version}</version>
                            <configuration>
                                <externalReport>false</externalReport>
                            </configuration>
                        </plugin>
                    </reportPlugins>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
            ...
        </plugins>
        ...
    </build>
    ...
</project>
```
