Dependency-Check
================

Dependency-Check is a utility that attempts to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within project dependencies. It does this by determining if there is a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier for a given dependency. If found, it will generate a report linking to the associated CVE entries.

More information can be found on the [wiki].

Usage
------------

```
$ mvn package
$ cd target/release/bin
$ dependency-check-[version].sh -h
$ dependency-check-[version].sh -a Testing -scan ../../test-classes
```

Then load the resulting 'DependencyCheck-Report.html' into your favorite browser.
