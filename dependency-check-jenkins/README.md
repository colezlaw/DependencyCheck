Dependency-Check Jenkins Plugin
==============================

The Dependency-Check Jenkins Plugin features the ability to perform a dependency
analysis build and later view results post build. The plugin is built using [analysis-core]
and features many of the same features that Jenkins static analysis plugins offer,
including thresholds, charts and the ability to view vulnerability information should
a dependency have one identified.

The main repository is located at [jenkins-cli/dependency-check-jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/dependency-check-jenkins).

The main site for documentation is located at [OWASP Dependency-Check-Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/OWASP+Dependency-Check+Plugin).

More information can be found on the [wiki].
